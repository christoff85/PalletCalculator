# PalletCalculator
Excel based application, that calculates the best possible package alligment on the pallet.

Includes Excel file with application. Some implementation at columns A-AA is hidden, because
it is mainly used as an interface for SolidWorks 3D model of the Pallet. But some of this data is used
to make additional calculations in the Worksheet, so deletion of these columns is not advised.
